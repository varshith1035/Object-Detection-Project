# For OpenCV(sample1.ipynb file)
# Basic OpenCV Commands and Their Applications

This notebook contains a collection of fundamental OpenCV commands commonly used in computer vision tasks. It demonstrates how to perform basic image processing operations using OpenCV in Python.

## Contents
- Reading and displaying images
- Image transformations (resize, rotate, crop)
- Color space conversions (BGR to RGB, grayscale)
- Drawing shapes and text on images
- Basic filtering and edge detection techniques
- Applications and examples for each command

## Purpose
This notebook serves as an introductory guide for beginners to understand and experiment with basic OpenCV functions, laying the foundation for more advanced computer vision projects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` package)
- Matplotlib (for displaying images)

## How to use
Run each code cell to see the effect of the commands on sample images. Modify the code to try different parameters and learn how image processing operations work.
