# Object Detection using YOLO Algorithm

This project implements object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system known for its speed and accuracy. It detects multiple objects in an image or video and classifies them in a single forward pass of the neural network.

## Features
- Real-time object detection
- Supports multiple classes
- Uses pre-trained YOLOv8 model for accurate detection
- Can be extended to custom datasets

## How it works
The YOLO model divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. The predictions are then filtered using confidence thresholds and non-max suppression to provide the final detected objects.

## Usage
- Load images or video streams
- Run the YOLO detection model
- Visualize bounding boxes and class labels on the input

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO package (or appropriate YOLO implementation)
